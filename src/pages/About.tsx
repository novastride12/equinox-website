  <p>
    <strong>Equinox</strong> is a student-led <strong>Space Technology Club</strong> based in
    <strong>Electronic City, Bangalore</strong>, founded with a clear purpose:
    to understand, design, and simulate space systems through engineering-driven
    exploration rather than surface-level enthusiasm.
  </p>

  <p>
    Space technology today demands more than curiosity — it demands
    <strong>systems thinking, mathematical rigor, computational skill, and
    disciplined experimentation</strong>. Equinox exists to cultivate these
    qualities in students who aspire to work at the intersection of aerospace,
    software, electronics, and applied physics.
  </p>

  <p>
    We view space not as an abstract fascination, but as a
    <strong>complex engineering domain</strong> — one that can be understood
    only by building, testing, simulating, and iterating.
  </p>
  <p>

  <h3>What We Focus On</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Rocketry &amp; Flight Systems</strong><br />
      Understanding propulsion, stability, trajectories, and recovery through
      simulations, design studies, and system-level reasoning.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Orbital Mechanics &amp; Mission Design</strong><br />
      Analyzing how spacecraft move, how orbits are planned, and how constraints
      shape real missions using physics-based models and computational tools.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Satellites &amp; Payload Systems</strong><br />
      Exploring small satellite architectures, onboard subsystems, payload
      concepts, and the engineering trade-offs behind them.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Software, Simulation &amp; Visualization</strong><br />
      Developing simulators, mission dashboards, and interactive visual models
      to represent space systems accurately and intuitively.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Astronomy &amp; Observational Space Science</strong><br />
      Conducting sky observation sessions, astrophotography, and data
      interpretation to connect theoretical knowledge with real celestial
      phenomena.
    </li>
  </ul><p></p>

  <h3>Our Working Philosophy</h3>

  <p>
    Equinox emphasizes <strong>depth over hype</strong>.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Strong fundamentals over shortcuts</li>
    <li>Engineering logic over memorization</li>
    <li>Iterative learning over one-time workshops</li>
    <li>Documentation and clarity over vague ideas</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Members are encouraged to break complex problems into solvable components,
    experiment responsibly, analyze failures, and refine solutions — mirroring
    how real aerospace systems are developed.
  </p><p></p>
<h3></h3>
  <h3>Who Equinox Is For</h3>

  <p>
    Equinox is open to students from
    <strong>Computer Science, Electronics, Electrical, Mechanical, and Physics</strong>
    backgrounds. Prior aerospace experience is <strong>not required</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>What matters is:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Genuine interest in space systems</li>
    <li>Willingness to learn fundamentals</li>
    <li>Problem-solving mindset</li>
    <li>Commitment and consistency</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Space technology is inherently interdisciplinary, and Equinox thrives on
    collaboration across domains.
  </p><p></p><hr></hr>

  <h3>Our Vision</h3>

  <p>
    Equinox aims to become a <strong>technically credible student space
    organization</strong> — one that produces members who understand space
    systems <strong>end-to-end</strong>, from physical principles to software
    abstraction.
  </p>

  <p>Our long-term goals include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Building technically sound projects and simulators</li>
    <li>Preparing members for research, internships, and advanced aerospace roles</li>
    <li>Creating a culture of seriousness, curiosity, and engineering discipline</li>
    <li>Establishing Equinox as a recognized technical space community in Bangalore</li>
  </ul><p></p>
<hr></hr>
  <h3>Why Equinox Exists</h3>

  <p>
    Because space deserves more than buzzwords.<br />
    Because real understanding comes from systems, not slides.<br />
    Because the future of space belongs to those who
    <strong>build, simulate, and reason deeply</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Equinox exists to learn space — properly.</strong>
